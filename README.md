#  🚀 ML-Workshop

Welcome to **ML-Workshop**, a hands-on space where I document everything I learn while studying during my machine learning journey.

The goal is to build a clear, practical reference for others studying ML—featuring intuitive explanations, clean implementations, and reproducible examples.

---

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this repository is to:

* Build a **solid foundation** in Python for ML & Data Science.
* Practice **real-world examples** using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
* Develop a habit of **experimenting and documenting** my learning process.
* Serve as a **personal reference** and a **public portfolio** of my ML journey.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **01 – Linear Regression** | Implement linear regression from scratch, visualize results, and compare manual vs. scikit-learn implementations |

*(More modules will be added soon)*
