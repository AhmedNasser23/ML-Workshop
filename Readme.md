# 🧠 ML-Workshop

Welcome to **ML-Workshop**, a hands-on space where I document everything I learn while studying **Machine Learning and Data Science using Python**.
This repository includes notebooks, experiments, exercises, and mini-projects inspired by my journey through the *Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass* on Udemy and beyond.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this repository is to:

* Build a **solid foundation** in Python for ML & Data Science.
* Practice **real-world examples** using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
* Develop a habit of **experimenting and documenting** my learning process.
* Serve as a **personal reference** and a **public portfolio** of my ML journey.
